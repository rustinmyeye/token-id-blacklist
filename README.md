# token-id-blacklist
A list of token ids marked as nsfw or scam based on ergexplorer reporting.

Use the python script to easily keep the list up to date. Install dependancy's with `pip install -r requirements.txt` then run the script with `python getblklstyml.py`. This will create the updated yaml file that can be pushed to this repo.
